# HTML Fundamentals Demo

(Open the google homepage image and identify the img tag, the input tag, the ul tag)

(open the html and point out the img tag, input tag inside a form tag, the ul inside a nav tag)

(open index.html with live server and point out that the content and structure is there but it still doesn't look like the wireframe, that is ok, html just puts the content in the right sequence but css will distribute it to the exact spot where you want it, add the css link tag and show the final site)
